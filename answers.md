# Additional Production-Grade Tests

I didn't manage to test my app as much as I wanted. I would consider **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in my next project.

- **Integration Tests**: Ensuring interaction between different modules is working.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulating real user journeys.
- **Resilience Testing**: Testing system robustness under high loads.

# How to Benchmark & Optimize Performance

## Benchmarking

- **Define Metrics**: Set key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Isolate Components**: Benchmark each component separately.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools and statistics to track performance over time via logs.

## Optimizing

- **Identify Inefficient Code Sections**: Replace repetitive or slow code blocks.
- **Scalability Improvements**:
  - Implement load balancing
  - Consider horizontal or vertical scaling
- **Asynchronous Queues**: Use message queues like **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**.

# Known OSINT Tool Bottlenecks and Mitigations

## Bottlenecks

- **Rate Limiting**: Websites and APIs often restrict access based on IP or repeated requests.
- **Processing Large Volumes of Data**: Analyzing vast amounts of unstructured data.
- **CAPTCHAs and Cloudflare**: Dynamic content can hinder scraping by automated tools.

## Mitigations

- **Proxies and VPNs**: Alter IP addresses to bypass rate limiting or geo-blocking.
- **Headless Browsers**: Use libraries such as **Selenium** or **Puppeteer** to simulate real user interaction.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Useful for parsing content rendered as images or behind CAPTCHAs.
